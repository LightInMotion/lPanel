In the subfolder "Builds" there is a folder for each build target.

Mac, iOS, and Windows are very straight forward. You either need
XCode from Apple (Mac and iOS) or Visual Studio 2010 from
Microsoft (Windows).

The free versions should open and build the included  projects
just fine, let us know if they do not.

The Linux folder simply contains a make file, since Linux always
includes a build environment. However, the system may not have
all the referenced development libraries. For Ununtu Linux I had
to install the following on a fresh install:

sudo apt-get -y install g++
sudo apt-get -y install libfreetype6-dev
sudo apt-get -y install libx11-dev
sudo apt-get -y install libxinerama-dev
sudo apt-get -y install libxcursor-dev
sudo apt-get -y install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt-get -y install libasound2-dev
sudo apt-get -y install freeglut3-dev

Android is, well, hell. See developer.android.com. You'll need the
latest SDK and NDK. AFTER you have the NDK samples building and
running you can build the native library with "ant debug" or "ant
release" from the command line. For the Java/packaging part, create
a new Android project in Eclipse "from existing sources" and point
to the Builds/Android folder.
