This project is intended to demonstrate the LivePanel network API.

LivePanel is part of the BlueLite X1 family of DMX control products.
See www.limsc.co for more information.

This sample application is written in C++ and can be compiled for:

- Windows
- Mac
- iOS
- Android
- Linux

For cross platform compatibility, it uses an open source framework called
JUCE, from Raw Material Software (www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce).

This project is based off the 'modules' branch of that library. However
please use care in updating. I have made some changes to the library
itself, adding extended UDP socket support and the ability to detect
suspend/resume operations. However, JUCE is a great library, well worth
checking out.

See the "Docs" folder for information on the LivePanel API itself.
There is also a brief document there on building.
